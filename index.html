        <h2 align="center">Certifications</h2>
        <h3> <b>Udemy's</b> 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp</h3>
        <p> Learned the programming language Python and the essentials of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript </p>
        <h3> <b>Accenture's</b> Project Management Virtual Experience </h3>
        <p> Tasks included understanding of different project management
          approaches, preparing a proposal for the optimal project management
          approach, and identifying the key attributes of a good project manager. </p>
        <h3> <b> JPMorgan Chase & Co. </b> Software Engineering Virtual Experience </h3>
        <p> This program is a virtual internship where I was given 3 tasks to work on. The tasks were
          designed to be similar to what a software engineer would do at this company. My first task was
          to create a chart on the trader’s dashboard that will allow them to see the undervalued and
          overvalued stocks. For my second task, I had to fix the web application that clients use. I had to
          ensure that the application displays a graph where it gets updated automatically. For my last task,
          I had to create a visually appealing graph that displayed the stock price data sheet to traders so
          that they could monitor their trading strategy. At the end of the program, I was given a certificate
          of completion. Overall, this software engineering virtual internship allowed me to explore what a
          software engineer would do at this company and the relationship between programming and
          business. </p>
        <h3> <b>Udemy's </b> Ultimate SEO Training </h3>
        <p> In this course, I learned the best SEO strategies to build a successfull
          SEO campaign. I learned how to see all the keywords that competitors are targeting,
           how to build high quality SEO backlinks, how to structure and optimize
            a website so that it can rank on page 1, how to find the best keywords
            to target, and how to deal with negative SEO. </p>

      <h3> Real Estate Investing Calculator </h3>
      <p> I created a program that gives a detailed review of costs and earnings
        when investing in certain properties with the goal of renting. The user
        must input the property information, such as sale price, monthly HOA, and
         State, and loan information, such as down payment (%), loan type, and
         interest rate. The user must also insert their estimated monthly rent.
        With this information, the program will calculate the initial investment
        needed for the property and the yearly investment using the yearly taxes,
        HOA, principal, and interest. Based on the yearly investment and yearly
        rent, the program will indicate if the property is profitable or not.
        This program was creating using the programming language Python. </p>

        <h3> Triangle Calculator </h3>
        <p> For my Programming for Engineers class, I worked with my professor
          to create a program that calculates the area of a triangle depending
          on the sides or angles that are inputted by the user. I was able to
          present my project and code to my classmates at the end of the semester.
        This program was creating using the programming language C. </p>

        <h3> Modeling and Analysis of the Spread of Infectious Diseases and Determining Factors </h3>
        <p> For my Calculus III class, I was able to work on my research project
          that focused on the spread of infectious diseases and how they can be
          studied by utilizing a SIR and SEIR model that analyzes the number of
          individuals susceptible, infected, exposed, and recovered through time.
          Throughout this research paper, the SIR and SEIR models were used to
          analyze the spread of Influenza and COVID-19 in order to understand
          how different variables contribute to the spread of such diseases.
          The objective of modeling and analyzing the spread of infectious diseases was
          to obtain a deeper understanding of the connection between calculus
          and biology. After completing this research project, Professor Pierre
          gave me the opportunity to present it at the Mathematics and Statistics
          Awareness Month event. </p>
